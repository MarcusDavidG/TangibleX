# TangibleX - One-Pager Pitch

## Tagline
**Democratizing Real-World Asset Investment Through AI-Powered Tokenization on Mantle Network**

---

## The Problem 🎯

Traditional real-world asset (RWA) investment faces critical barriers:
- **High Entry Costs**: Minimum investments of $100K+ exclude 99% of potential investors
- **Illiquidity**: Assets take months/years to sell, locking up capital
- **Geographic Limits**: Investors restricted to local markets
- **Opaque Processes**: Due diligence is expensive and time-consuming

**Market Opportunity**: $16 trillion in tokenizable real-world assets by 2030 (BCG)

---

## Our Solution 💡

TangibleX is a complete RealFi infrastructure platform that:

1. **Tokenizes Real-World Assets** - Real estate, invoices, bonds become tradeable ERC-20 tokens
2. **AI-Powered Analysis** - Automated risk scoring and yield prediction using GPT-4
3. **Automated Oracles** - Real-time price feeds and automated yield distribution
4. **Built-In Compliance** - KYC-gated transfers ensure regulatory compliance
5. **Fractional Ownership** - Invest from $100 instead of $100,000
